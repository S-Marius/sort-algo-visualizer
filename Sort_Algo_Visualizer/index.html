            <h2>Sorting Algorithms</h2>

            <p>
                In computer science, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order, which can be a <span>numerical</span> or <span>lexicographical</span> order.
            </p>

            <p>
                This operation is one of the most important and widespread in computer science. For a long time, new
                methods have been developed to make this procedure faster and faster.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are currently hundreds of different sorting algorithms, each with its own specific
                characteristics. They are classified according to two metrics: <span>space complexity</span> and <span>time complexity</span>.
            </p>

            <p>Most of them fall into two categories:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Logarithmic<br>
                    A logarithmic algorithm is an algorithm whose time complexity is logarithmic. This means that the running time increases slowly as the input size increases. Logarithmic algorithms are generally considered to be very efficient because they can handle large inputs without taking too much time. An example of a logarithmic algorithm is binary search, which is used to search for an element in a sorted list.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Quadratic<br>
                    A quadratic algorithm is an algorithm whose time complexity is quadratic. This means that the running time is proportional to the square of the size of the input. Quadratic algorithms can be very inefficient because they take a long time to run on large inputs. An example of a quadratic algorithm is bubble sort, a simple sorting algorithm that compares pairs of elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                Space and time complexity can also be further subdivided into 3 different cases: best case, average case and
                worst case.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sorting algorithms can be difficult to understand and it's easy to get confused. We believe visualizing
                sorting algorithms can be a great way to better understand their functioning while having fun!
